# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This is my repository for the Coursera's course "Exploratory Data Analysis". Currently there are 8 files for the Course Project 1: 4 png pictures and 4 scripts to generate each.

* Download the data from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip)
* Extract the data into the working directory;
* Run the scripts

The names of the X axis in plot 4 were removed and the names of the Y axis were fixed to make the graphs look more consistent.
